# TO-Shelters
### Visualizing the dependency of daily shelters in the City of Toronto over the past few years
A few observations made while building this project:
- There are equal amounts of daily shelters per sections (Families, Co-Ed, Women, Men, Youth).
- In 2017 there were spikes of shelter capacity and occupancy each month with the lowest hit low 4 thousand and highest hit high 5 thousand. (Refer to Shelter-2017.pdf)
- Also in 2017, the shelters seemed to be geared towards men and families but became more dominantly focused on family in 2018 and 2019. (Refer to shelters-donut files). This might have to do with increase in capacity in later years.
- Through 2018 there were more daily shelters capacity increased which lead to a capacity of a little over 7 thousand. This stayed consistent throughout 2019. (Refer to Shelter-2018.pdf and Shelter-2019.pdf)
- The spread of daily shelters and dependency is not as equal expected.(Refer to Neighbourhood_shelters html files)
